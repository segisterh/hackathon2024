# Hackathon 2024 - Enhanced Positioning Algorithm

This repository documents our Hackathon 2024 project, which focused on developing an accurate and efficient positioning algorithm using wireless communication channel state information (CSI) data.

## Introduction

Our project aimed to enhance positioning accuracy through innovative techniques, including:

- Extracting spatial and frequency domain features.
- Applying dimensionality reduction methods like PCA.
- Combining neural networks and regression models in an ensemble framework.

## Highlights

- **Feature Engineering**: Designed robust feature sets using amplitude, phase, and statistical metrics.
- **Model Design**: Implemented a hybrid ensemble approach, leveraging neural networks and traditional regression techniques.
- **Results**: Achieved a high prediction accuracy with minimal error, demonstrating the potential of CSI-based positioning systems.

## Future Directions

- **Real-Time Processing**: Adapting the algorithm for dynamic, real-time applications.
- **Advanced Models**: Exploring transformer-based architectures for richer feature representation.
- **Deployment**: Optimizing the algorithm for embedded systems to expand practical use cases.
